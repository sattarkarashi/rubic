This project is a Python implementation of a solver for Rubik's cube puzzles. It uses a technique known as the "Minimal Thinking" technique to recognize the type of problem and use a predetermined result to jump straight to the solution1.

Features
Solves 1x2x2, 1x2x3, and 2x2x2 Rubikâ€™s cube puzzles.
Uses the "Minimal Thinking" technique to minimize the thought process behind solving the problem.
Recognizes the current arrangement and orientation of the individual pieces of the puzzle and rearranges and reorients the pieces into the final state.
